Project Title: Deploying a Website on AWS Using S3 and CloudFront

Project Description: This project focuses on deploying a fully functional and scalable website using Amazon Web Services (AWS). The primary objective is to leverage AWS's S3 (Simple Storage Service) for secure and cost-effective static website hosting, along with CloudFront for fast content delivery through a global content delivery network (CDN). The deployment ensures high availability, performance, and security of the website.

Key Technologies Used:

Amazon S3: Utilized for storing and hosting the website's static files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).
Amazon CloudFront: Configured as a CDN to deliver the content with low latency and high transfer speeds to users around the globe.
This project demonstrates the practical application of cloud computing services to build, deploy, and manage a website with AWS, highlighting best practices for security, scalability, and performance optimization.
